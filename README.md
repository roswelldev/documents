# ðŸ¤“ Welcome to Fivemerr

### About Fivemerr

Fivemerr was created by MonkeyWhisper, owner of [Project Sloth](https://discord.gg/projectsloth) and [1 of 1 Servers](https://www.1of1servers.com/), in response to the lack of CDN services for FiveM images, videos, and sounds. While initially designed for FiveM, our API can be integrated with almost any platform or games.

### Why is this free?

We believe in giving back to the community that has supported and encouraged us to work on various projects. Project Sloth embodies this spirit of giving back, and Fivemerr is another way for us to show our gratitude.

### How are you able to offer this?

Fivemerr operates on hardware owned by [1 of 1 Servers](https://www.1of1servers.com/). Since we own all the hardware, we can provide this service for free thanks to our infrastructure.

### Where are the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy?

We use the 1 of 1 Servers Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which can be found [here.](https://www.1of1servers.com/terms)
